# CAPSHA
making a CAPSHA

You need:

A database with thr following tables:

capsha
login

In the capsha table you only need id(int and primary) and capsha(text)

Add as many entries that you want for the capshas with 5 characters(number/letters/symbols)

You will need to change in capsha.php how many entries that you have right at the beginning of the php file.

In the login table, you will need id (int and primary), username(text) and password(text)

After setting up the database, you will need to change the database name, username and password for the database in the php files that was provided. 

On you server, you will need a folder called img, so that the image that is generated from the CAPSHA has a place to go. If you change the folder name and placement, you will need to to the same in the php files.
