# CAPSHA
making a CAPSHA


First you will need to have a database where you store the table for the CAPSSHA entries and username/. I added 102 entries for the numbers/letters/symbols but you can add as little or as much that you want. Just change how many entries that you have in capsha.php right at the begining of the file.
